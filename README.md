CAMELOT Data Model

The purpose of the project is to define a semantic data model to describe objects within the scope of the Bodleian Libraries.

The data model is designed at a conceptual level to represent accurately the state of knowledge about the items in our collections. This knowledge is not necessarily absolute, certain or objective - assertions may require provenance or qualification. This contrasts with a typical library catalogue approach which sacrifices both accuracy and veracity for the sake of completeness.

By taking this approach, we design systems that permit researchers and academics to publish their findings and outputs, no matter how small, alongside our collections, enhancing the value of collections and providing exposure to our research outputs. Thus we have the potential to conflate the source material, the research process, and the final research into a cohesive whole.

All BDLSS projects should be evaluated against the data model - and should either use the data model or inform the development of it.
